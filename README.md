## üîç Overview

Whether you're handling a few thousand visitors daily on your eCommerce platform or drawing in large crowds to your content, it's essential that your site is fast and always available to keep your audience engaged. Our cloud solutions ensure **high availability**, **speed**, **scalability**, and **security** ‚Äî so you can confidently deliver a seamless digital experience.

WordPress on Azure App Service is a fully managed PaaS offering that takes care of infrastructure maintenance, security patching, and scaling for you as described [here](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/blob/main/WordPress/wordpress_auto_updates.md). It also supports virtual networks and can run in an isolated, dedicated App Service Environment. Features like automatic WordPress updates, threat detection, and free SSL encryption are included to enhance security for all our customers.

While there are multiple WordPress options on Azure, we recommend starting with [WordPress on Azure App Service](https://aka.ms/linux-wordpress) from the Azure Marketplace. This Marketplace offering is optimized for Linux App Service, making it easy to install. This comes with the latest software packages, tailored SKU sizes for both Azure App Service and Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, and include dedicated support from the App Service team.
